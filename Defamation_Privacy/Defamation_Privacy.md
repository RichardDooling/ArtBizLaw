# Defamation and Privacy 

###### by Richard Dooling &copy;

Artists have First Amendment rights to tell stories, 
or write songs, or make movies, 
but what happens when those free speech rights 
collide with the rights of others? 
What if an author's bestselling memoir 
names names, and defames others in the telling of his tale?
What if by telling her own story, 
she invades the privacy of others? 
"Steals" their "life story"? 
Publicly discloses embarrassing private facts about their lives?

Every major film attracts lawsuits, 
and some plaintiffs sue 
even though they are not mentioned by name. 
Docu-dramas invite litigation. 
Imagine documentary filmmakers wearing hidden microphones 
and cameras making a documentary about a quack doctor 
who is selling banned substances, 
or unsafe herbal remedies? 
Invasion of privacy? 
Or investigative journalism 
or some other species of reality entertainment?

## "Life Story Rights" 

Telling "based upon," nonfiction stories about others 
often treads on what the industry calls "life story rights," 
not a legal term, just a handy grab bag term for the rights involved. 
The artist (filmmaker, storyteller, photographer, fine artist, 
even songwriters) wants to tell a person's "life story" 
or use their name, image or likeness without getting sued for it.

These so-called life story rights 
are different in every jurisdiction.
Lawyers must watch out for international law, 
American constitutional law (the First Amendment), 
and a patchwork quilt of State laws.
Some states (notably Alabama, Tennessee, and California) 
zealously protect the inherited privacy rights of dead celebrities, 
and allow the heirs of Martin Luther King, Elvis Presley, and the Three Stooges 
to protect the rights of their famous dead former citizens. 
Even dead celebrities sometimes have publicity rights,
and their heirs can sue to protect those rights in state court. 
But those celebrity rights many not tread 
on the First Amendment rights of authors and artists.
Authors are free to tell stories about dead people 
by creating biographical works, history, film, fiction, news and the like.
These works are protected speech under the First Amendment and the Copyright clause. 
But celebrities have a different parallel right 
to "commercial" exploitation of their names, image, and likeness. 

More important than theoretical doctrinal hair-splitting
of First Amendment theories and privacy rights 
is to make sure that authors and filmmakers who want to tell fact-based stories
about people living or dead get a "life rights" agreement,
a collection of contract provisions dealing with story rights and waivers of liability.
Again all of these rights are jurisdiction-specific 
and depend on careful, 
specific drafting of contract provisions . 

#### Acquiring Life Story Rights

If possible artist and living subject 
execute a simple agreement, 
wherein the subject promises not to sue 
for defamation, invasion of privacy, use of name, image, or likeness, 
and a number of other claims. 
A nice description can be found in a passage called 
["Fact-Based Stories"](http://www.richarddooling.com/ArtBizLaw/Fact_Based_Stories.pdf) 
from the [Independent Producers Survival Guide: A Business and Legal Sourcebook][survival] 4th Ed. (2009), by Gunnar Erickson, Mark Halloran & Harris Tulchin. See also, [Purchasing Life Story Rights By: Mark Litwak](http://www.marklitwak.com/purchasing-life-story-rights.html).

Here are some links to sample life story rights agreements and templates:

- [Life Story Rights Agreement, courtesy of the Northern Kentucky University Chase College of Law.] (http://chaselaw.nku.edu/content/dam/chaselaw/docs/centersandinstitute/Law---Informatics/LifeStoryRightsAgreement.pdf)
- [Done Deal: Life Rights Option Agreement.](https://www.donedealpro.com/members/details.aspx?object_id=280&content_type=1&section_id=13)
- [Done Deal: Life Rights Agreement.](https://www.donedealpro.com/members/details.aspx?object_id=582&content_type=1&section_id=13)

If an agreement can't be had, 
storytellers and filmmakers may proceed, 
but often the script or the nonfiction book 
will be annotated. 
All factual statements about living people and historical events, 
will be annotated with sources. 


## Defamation

Stories, songs, movies, even photos about real people, 
may defame them, 
if those works of art contain or suggest false statements of fact.

### Libel v. Slander

Two forms: Libel and slander.

* Libel (mneumonic sounds like "label") is defamation in print; it's written or recorded, as in television or movies. 
* Slander is defamation by way of the spoken word.

#### Defamation Per Se

All states, 
except Arizona, Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee, 
recognize that some categories of false statements are so harmful 
that they are considered to be *defamatory per se*. 
In the common law tradition, 
damages for such false statements are presumed and do not have to be proven.

Statements are defamatory per se where they falsely impute to the plaintiff one or more of the following:

1. Allegations or imputations "injurious to another in their trade, business, or profession"
2. Allegations or imputations "of loathsome disease" (historically leprosy and sexually transmitted disease, now also includes mental illness)
3. Allegations or imputations of "unchastity" (usually only in unmarried people and sometimes only in women)
4. Allegations or imputations of criminal activity (sometimes only crimes of [moral turpitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_turpitude))

### Defamation Meets First Amendment

Sometimes called the constitutionalization of defamation law, 
[*New York Times v. Sullivan*][sullivan] 
changed everything for public officials 
who don't like the way they are portrayed in the press. 
It all started in Montgomery, Alabama and the civil rights movement in the South. 

#### Elements

First let's look at the rules for stating a claim for defamation as they existed before [*New York Time v. Sullivan*][sullivan]. 

A plaintiff suing for defamation had to prove:

1. A statement had been made about the plaintiff;
2. The statement had been "published" to at least one other party;
3. The statement was false (presumed at common law);
4. The statement harmed the subject's reputation by lowering his or her standing in at least some part of the community.

## *New York Times v. Sullivan*

###### US Supreme Court 1964

* [*New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=376+us+254&appflag=67.12), 376 U.S. 254 (1964). 
* [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan).
* [NYTimes Editorial: The Uninhibited Press 50 Years Later](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/opinion/sunday/the-uninhibited-press-50-years-later.html).
* [Image of "Heed Their Rising Voices" ad][heed]'
* [Transcript of "Heed Their Rising Voices ad][heed_transcript] 

On March 29th, 1960, civil rights groups, including The Committee To Defend Martin Luther King and The Struggle For Freedom In The South ran a full-page advertisement in the New York Times. The ad, captioned ["Heed Their Rising Voices,"][heed], began:

> As the whole world knows by now, 
> thousands of Southern Negro students are engaged 
> in wide-spread non-violent demonstrations 
> in positive affirmation of the right to live in human dignity 
> as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 
> In their efforts to uphold these guarantees, 
> they are being met by an unprecedented wave of terror 
> by those who would deny and negate that document 
> which the whole world looks upon as setting the pattern for modern freedom.

The ad went on to list examples of official police intimidation and alleged that certain actions and events had deprived the students and demonstrators of their rights. 

> It is uncontroverted that some of the statements 
> contained in the two paragraphs 
> were not accurate descriptions of events which occurred in Montgomery.

L.B. Sullivan was the police commissioner for the city of Montgomery. 
Even though he wasn't named in the ad, 
Sullivan filed suit against the *New York Times*, 
alleging that it had wrongfully implied that he was guilty of misconduct. 
Four other suits were filed by other government officials. 

At trial the evidence showed 
that at least some of the statements in the ad were incorrect. 
The trial jury awarded Sullivan $500,000 in damages, 
and the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the verdict. 

A unanimous Supreme Court reversed, 
in essence overruling Alabama's interpretation of its own defamation laws. 
The Court held that the First Amendment 
required that in defamation actions brought by public officials, 
the plaintiff official must prove 
that the statement was made with "*actual malice*"--meaning it was made 
*with knowledge that the statement was false* 
or *with reckeless disregard for the truth*. 

> We consider this case 
> against the background of a profound national commitment 
> to the principle that debate on public issues 
> should be uninhibited, robust, and wide- open, 
> and that it may well include vehement, caustic, 
> and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public official.

To protect news organizations from defamation claims, 
the Supreme Court held that the Constitution 
required public officials to prove actual malice to state a claim. 
Not only that, but in defamation cases, 
appellate court were charged with the duty 
to examine *the entire record* on review 
to insure that a trial judgment did not tread on First Amendment freedoms. 

#### Lawsuits Over False Statements of Fact

In the wake of [*New York Times v. Sullivan,*][sullivan] 
the defamation rules changed 
and prospective plaintiffs were sorted into at least four different categories: 

- Private Figures (Ordinary People)
- Public Officials (Politicians) 
- Public Figures (Celebrities)
- Limited Purpose Public Figures (ordinary people who suddenly become famous because of their association with a particular event or issue).

If a public official or a public figure (celebrity) wishes to sue someone for defaming them they must prove [actual malice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_malice).

> One who publishes a false and defamatory communication 
> concerning a public official or public figure 
> in regard to his conduct, fitness or role in that capacity 
> is subject to liability, if, but only if, he:

> 1.  knows that the statement is false and that it defames the other person, or
> 2.  acts in reckless disregard of these matters.

[ยง 580A Restatement 2nd of Torts: Defamation of Public Official or Public Figure](http://tinyurl.com/kmvz6gy)

Do not confuse *actual malice* with *legal malice*. 
In defamation law, actual malice means 
the defendant who allegedly made a defamatory statement
did so with *with knowledge that the statement was false* 
or *with reckeless disregard for the truth* 
Actual malice does not mean evil intent or evil purpose, 
it means the defendant knew the statement was false and made it anyway, 
or had reckless disregard for the truth.

#### Complexity

Like the question of privacy rights, 
defamation law is complex. How complex?
Take a look at a table we use in media law to decide fault standards, damages, 
and burdens of proof in defamation cases.

Plaintiff's Status  | Minimum Fault Standard | Damages Available | Burden of Proof |
------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
Public official or figure | Clear Actual Malice | Presumed and Punitive | Plaintiff Proves Falsity|
Private Figure, Public Concern | Negligence | Compensatory "Actual" | Plaintiff Proves Falsity |
Private Figure, Private Concern | Probably Strict Liability | Presumed and Punitive | Truth a Defense<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> |

<b id="f1">1</b> Not resolved by [*Hepps*][hepps], 
in which a state statute said that defendants had the burden of proving that allegedly defamatory statements were true. 
The trial judge thought the statute was unconstitutional 
and instructed the jury that the plaintiff bore the burden of proving falsity:[โฉ](#a1)

> To ensure that true speech on matters of public concern is not deterred, 
> we hold that the common-law presumption 
> that defamatory speech is false cannot stand 
> when a plaintiff seeks damages against a media defendant.

[*Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps.* (S.Ct. 1986)][hepps]

And that's just state and federal law in the United States.

#### International Comparisons

Should the law force the allegedly defamed plaintiff 
to prove that the communications were false? 
Or should we instead force the defendant media company 
to prove that the statements were true? 

At common law, the defamed plaintiff made her claim,
and the allegedly defamatory statement was presumed to be false,
and it was up to the defendant to assert truth as a defense. 
But modern American defamation law sometimes makes the plaintiff prove falsity.

In England, this development was specifically rejected in [*Derbyshire County Council v. Times Newspapers Ltd*](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/law-report-local-authorities-cannot-institute-libel-actions-derbyshire-county-council-v-times-newspapers-ltd-and-others--house-of-lords-lord-keith-lord-griffiths-lord-goff-of-chieveley-lord-brownewilkinson-and-lord-woolf-18-february-1993-1473954.html) (1993), and it was also rejected in Canada in [*Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_v._Church_of_Scientology_of_Toronto) (1995), and more recently in [*Grant v. Torstar Corp.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_v._Torstar_Corp.) (2009). 

In Australia, the High Court held in [*Theophanous v. The Herald & Weekly Times Ltd*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophanous_v_Herald_%26_Weekly_Times_Ltd) (1994) that the Australian constitution implied a freedom of political communication and a freedom to publish material discussing government and political matters, but *Theophanous* was overruled by the High Court of Australia in [*Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lange_v_Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation) (1997).

As in privacy rights and celebrity/publicity rights, the protection or licensing of rights call for expert contract draftsmanship. 

Now let's look at some entertainment industry cases where public officials and figures alleged defamation.

## *Davis v. Constantin Costa-Gavras*

###### US District Court, S.D. New York (1987)

* [case at Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15465616831450742963)
* [case at Westlaw](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=654fsupp653&appflag=67.12)
* [Loyola Entertainment Law Journal Case Note](http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1134&context=elr).

A summary of events leading up to the lawsuit:

> Thomas Hauser wrote a book, *The Execution of Charles Horman,* which developed the thesis of Ed Horman, Charles' father, that the US military in Chile had known and approved of the killing of his son by Pinochet's troops. Four years later, Costa-Gavras made a well-received movie, *Missing*, starring Jack Lemmon in the role of Ed Horman and Sally Field as his wife. *Missing* was a fictionalized version of the book, *Execution*, with the U.S. military head named Ray Tower. Davis, who had not sued the book's author or publisher, sued the movie director and studio for defamation. The legal issue posed by the case was whether there was any evidence of "actual malice" that would satisfy the *New York Times* standard.

> Paul C. Weiler, Gary Myers, *Entertainment, Media, and the Law: Text, Cases, and Problems* (4th Ed. 2011).

MILTON POLLACK, Senior District Judge.

The defamation charged in the complaint is that in their film, "Missing," 
defendants (including Universal Studios) allegedly portrayed with actual malice that plaintiff, the Commander of the United States Military Group and Chief of the United States Mission to Chile at the time of the 1973 coup in Chile, ordered or approved a Chilean order to kill Charles Horman, an American residing in Chile.

Actual malice is established in a public figure defamation litigation 
only where defendant publishes a statement 
"with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not." 
[*New York Times v. Sullivan,* (S.Ct. 1964) ][sullivan]. 
Reckless disregard in such a case means 
that a defendant published after he "in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication." [*St. Amant v. Thompson* (S.Ct. 1968.)][amant]

### *Designated Evidence Offered by Plaintiff*

Plaintiff alleges that there are four general categories of purported
evidence in the paper defense to the motion from which to find actual
malice on behalf of defendants: 

1. that defendants' "entire purpose in making 'Missing' was to show plaintiff as responsible for Charles Horman's death"; 
2. that defendants' reliance on Thomas Hauser's book *The Execution of Charles Horman ("Execution")* was unreasonable; 
3. that defendants never consulted with plaintiff on the facts presented in the film; and 
4. that "Missing" contains scenes portraying certain episodes which defendants knew were embroidered.

An analysis of the record shows that to accept the plaintiff's opposition to summary judgment would require a distortion of the proofs, deviation from applicable law, and wrenching of the film out of its plain context.

#### A. *The Thesis of the Film*

Plaintiff has produced no evidence in his papers to substantiate his
assertion that the purpose of "Missing" was to make a non-fictional film
establishing that Ray Davis, the plaintiff, was responsible for Charles
Horman's death. To the contrary, the papers unalterably establish that
the film is not a non-fictional documentary or aimed at Ray Davis as an
individual, and that it cannot be understood as other than a
dramatization of a true story. The film includes fictional characters
and a composite portrayal of the American military presence in Chile at
the time of the uprising and Allende coup.

The theme of the film is the search for a missing man by his father and
his wife. The man who disappeared is finally found to have been executed
by the Chilean military. The film is *based upon* a true story. It is
only in that setting that the composite conduct of the American
governmental representatives in Chile at the time and the degree of
their assistance in that search comes under scrutiny and criticism.
There is no person named Ray Davis referred to in the film at any time.
Ray Tower, with whom the plaintiff associates himself, is a symbolic
fictional composite of the entire American political and military
entourage in Chile.

The film derives from and is solidly documented and supported by the
stories relied on by the filmmakers, taken from the acts and statements
of the concerned father and the anguished wife set forth in detail in
Thomas Hauser's book, *Execution.* Those sources are shown to have been
heavily investigated and confirmed by the filmmakers, who entertained no
serious doubts of their truth or knowledge to the contrary of what they
portrayed.

We pause to point out that the Supreme Court has emphasized that "actual
malice" in the context of the First Amendment does not even include
"spite, hostility or intention to harm." &hellip; Rather, the actual malice inquiry
focuses on the publisher's state of mind regarding the truth of his
statements.&hellip;

#### B. *Defendants' Reliance on Hauser's Book*

"Missing" is a dramatic portrayal of events and interpretations detailed
in Thomas Hauser's book, *Execution.* The substance of the movie's
scenes is extracted directly from *Execution.* To meet those facts,
plaintiff purports to suggest that defendants' reliance on Hauser's book
was unreasonable and that Hauser's credentials would have disclosed him
to be "suspect" had a good faith search by defendants been made.

As a matter of law, to prevail on a defamation claim against a public
official a plaintiff must do more than propound potential avenues of
investigation that a defendant might have pursued. "[M]ere proof of
failure to investigate, without more, cannot establish reckless
disregard for the truth."

> Rather, a public figure defamation plaintiff must show either that the
publisher actually entertained serious doubts about the veracity of the
publication, or that there are '*obvious* reasons to doubt the veracity
of the informant or the accuracy of his reports.'"&hellip; 

There is nothing in the record tending to show that the filmmakers
questioned Hauser's credentials or his book in any respect at the time
"Missing" was made. The record is to the contrary. The filmmakers met
with Hauser, went over his investigation and sources, supplied him with
drafts of the script under preparation and were satisfied that there was
no reason to doubt his work. No evidence whatever challenges those
facts. Certainly the filmmakers obtained no knowledge contradicting the
veracity or accuracy of Hauser's book and the stories of the Hormans as
told to them and reflected in the book. There is no suggestion to the
contrary from any provable sources. Indeed, nothing in plaintiff's
papers demonstrates that either Hauser's credentials or his book, which
was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, are in fact "suspect" in any way.

The filmmakers knew that Hauser was a lawyer who had served as a
judicial clerk in the Chambers of a Federal Judge and then worked for a
prestigious Wall Street law firm. They knew that Hauser interviewed
Captain Ray Davis, as well as other United States officials in Chile and
numerous other persons when preparing *Execution.* The filmmakers also
knew that no legal action whatsoever was taken against the book in the
approximately four years since its publication. In an August 1980
meeting where Costa-Gavras, the film's director, and Stewart, the
co-scriptwriter, met with Hauser to verify the accuracy of his book,
Hauser described his meticulous research methods and broad inquiries.
There is no evidence to the contrary.

The filmmakers then met with Charles Horman's parents, his wife, and one
Terry Simon, a close friend who was in Chile with Charles around the
time of his disappearance. Each of these individuals made clear to
Costa-Gavras and Stewart that Hauser's book accurately and reliably
depicted events as they knew and believed them. There is no evidence
that any of defendants' further research and review of documents
 regarding Horman and events in Chile during the coup caused
them to doubt the veracity of Hauser's book.

Plaintiff argues that an effective search of Hauser's background would
have disclosed "fraudulent letters" sent by Hauser to political figures
and The New York Times. This allusion is to Hauser's political satires
where he had written on public issues to officials in the voice of a
nine-year old boy, "Martin Bear." The New York Times, in fact, solicited
from Hauser and published on its "op-ed" page one of these satirical
pieces, which can hardly be reason to "suspect" the veracity of his
book.

In any event, plaintiff has neither presented nor designated specific
facts suggesting or from which it could be reasonably inferred and found
that defendants entertained serious doubts as to Hauser's account or
that there were obvious reasons to doubt the veracity or accuracy of
Hauser's book. Absent such evidence, reliance on *Execution* is not
evidence of actual malice. [*Herbert v. Lando*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16697660620075994229) (plaintiff must show either that publisher "entertained serious doubts"
or "obvious reasons" to doubt source). [*St. Amant*][amant] ("[R]eckless conduct is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published or would have investigated before publishing.")

#### C. *Failure to Consult Plaintiff Prior to Making Film*

Plaintiff argues that defendant's failure to consult plaintiff
personally prior to presentation of the film is evidence of actual
malice.

However, plaintiff cannot prove actual malice merely by asserting that a publisher failed to contact the subject of his work. *See* [*Vandenburg v. Newsweek, Inc.* (5th Cir.1975)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6613184420209694118) (failure to verify story with plaintiff prior to publication insufficient evidence of actual malice.).

The actual malice standard cannot be satisfied by evidence of a
failure to check with third parties prior to publication without proof
that a publisher knew his publication was false, entertained serious
doubts as to its truth, or had obvious reasons to doubt the veracity or
accuracy of the source of published information. *See* [*New York Times
v. Sullivan*][sullivan] (and others). 

While "verification of facts" of a story with its subjects and with
others is a desirable and responsible practice and "an important
reporting standard, a reporter, without a 'high degree of awareness of
their probable falsity,' may rely on statements made by a single source
even though they reflect only one side of the story without fear of
libel prosecution.&hellip;" 

Plaintiff has not designated specific facts suggesting an awareness or
even suspicion by defendants of probable falsity of their source
material.

#### D. *Scenes in "Missing" as Evidence Of Actual Malice*

Plaintiff enumerates nine scenes in "Missing" which the filmmakers
allegedly created, or in which they distorted the context, or made
baseless suggestions. None of these scenes provides or contributes to
the requisite evidence of actual malice.

It should be made clear that "Missing" is not a documentary, but a
dramatization of the Horman disappearance and search. The film does not
purport to depict a chronology of the events precisely as they actually
occurred; it opens with the prologue: "This film is *based on* a true
story. The incidents and facts are documented. Some of the names have
been changed to protect the innocent and also to protect the film."
(emphasis supplied). No one challenged the accuracy and veracity of
Hauser's book to the knowledge of defendants. Defendants concede that
although the substance of the film's scenes is extracted almost directly
from Thomas Hauser's book, not  everything in their film is
literally faithful to the actual historical record as if in a
documentary. That is not to say that which was not historical was set
out in bad faith, portrayed with actual malice, or established or
increased the defamatory impact.

The film is not a documentary. A documentary is a non-fictional story or
series of historical events portrayed in their actual location; a film
of real people and real events as they occur. A documentary maintains
strict fidelity to fact.

"Missing," on the other hand, is an art form sometimes described as
"Docu-Drama." The line separating a documentary from a docudrama is not
always sharply defined, but is nonetheless discernible. Both forms are
necessarily selective, given the time constraints of movies and the
attention span of the viewing audience. The docudrama is a dramatization
of an historical event or lives of real people, using actors or
actresses. Docudramas utilize simulated dialogue, composite characters,
and a telescoping of events occurring over a period into a composite
scene or scenes. This treatment is singularly appropriate and
unexceptionable if the context is not distorted when dealing with public
and political figures.

Self-evidently a docudrama partakes of author's license โ it is a
creative interpretation of reality โ and if alterations of fact in
scenes portrayed are not made with serious doubts of truth of the
essence of the telescoped composite, such scenes do not ground a charge
of actual malice.

Each scene questioned by the plaintiff is a telescoped composite of
events, personalities, and of the American representatives in Chile who
are involved therein. Each uses permissible literary license to fit
historical detail into a suitable dramatic context. Such dramatic
embellishments as are made do not distort the fundamental story being
told โ the frantic search by his family for a missing man who has
suddenly disappeared, their emotions, anxieties, impatience,
frustration, and doubts of assistance from American officialdom. The
scenes are thus a hybrid of fact and fiction which however do not
materially distort the analysis. Always to be remembered is that they
fairly represent the source materials for the film believed to be true
by the filmmakers. Leeway is properly afforded to an author who thus
attempts to recount a true event.

As a matter of law, the dramatic overlay supplied by the film does not
serve to increase the impact of what plaintiff charges as defamatory
since it fairly and reasonably portrays the unassailable beliefs of the
Hormans, the record thereof in the Hauser book, and the corroborative
results of the authors' inquiries. In docudrama, minor fictionalization
cannot be considered evidence or support for the requirement of actual
malice.

The nine scenes selected by plaintiff as support for the requirement of
actual malice do no such thing. Each is related solely and
unquestionably to the theme of this film. The movie's Ray Tower
character is a fictional composite of the American presence operating in
Chile at the time. He is a symbolic figure. The artistic input in the
scenes questioned is found in permissible syntheses and composite
treatment in the film. Although in actuality particular individuals were
not physically present when certain dialogue occurred, in the movie
scene the composite character portrayed was.

The content of the film reflects what happened according to the book,
the persons who complained, and the sources relied on by defendants.
While the actual persons involved in the events portrayed do not appear
in on-scene interviews to describe their experiences, actions, and
motivations, the real names of some individuals are employed. But the
name Ray Davis is never mentioned. Real life personalities are
accordingly represented by telescoped composites in many
instances.

The cases on point demonstrate that the First Amendment protects such
dramatizations and does not demand literal truth in every episode
depicted; publishing a dramatization is not of itself evidence of actual
malice.

In [*Street v. National Broadcasting Co.* (6th Cir.),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4559741824903610057), the
Court of Appeals affirmed a ruling on a directed verdict that the
dramatization embodied in defendant's broadcast program on the
Scottsboro rape trial was protected by the [*New York Times v.
Sullivan*][sullivan] standard, and not chargeable with actual malice. While the dramatization
 contained certain literal falsehoods, including undocumented
statements and conversations &hellip; the movie was based "in all material respects" on the Judge's findings in the Scottsboro case, and a book by a historian documenting the
Scottsboro trial. *Id.* at 1237. 

> Such techniques do not rise to the constitutional level of clear and
> convincing showing of reckless disregard.... [D]eviations from or
> embellishments upon the information obtained from the primary sources
> relied upon were miniscule and can be attributed to the leeway
> afforded an author who attempts to recount and popularize an historic
> event."&hellip; 

#### *Conclusion*

The issue on the motion is not the truth of whether Davis (qua Ray
Tower) ordered or approved a Chilean order to kill Charles Horman
because he "knew too much" about alleged American involvement in the
Chilean coup; the issue is whether the filmmakers intentionally
portrayed such a defamatory suggestion, knowing that it was false or
with serious doubts of its truth. There is no doubt that Ed Horman, the
father of the missing man, asserted such a theory and that assertion is
documented in Hauser's book. Plaintiff has not presented evidence that
defendants knew the theory of the father was false, or entertained
serious doubts as to its truth. There is no evidence that defendants
acted with actual malice or disbelieved what the Hormans thought and
said or what Hauser wrote.

In sum, returning to the *ratio decidendi;* no provable, clear and
convincing, affirmative evidence nor specific facts showing actual
malice on the part of the defendants in publishing the alleged
defamation have been shown, and the complaint by plaintiff, a public
figure, falls as not sustainable under the law.

The complaint is dismissed, with costs.

SO ORDERED.

#### APPENDIX

The plaintiff has designated the following nine scenes in the film
purportedly as the evidence he has that defendants published the film
with actual malice.

##### 1. *Initial Embassy Scene*

The scene depicts a meeting where it is reported that Tower and his
staff have conducted interviews in the area where Charles was last seen.
Tower states he is having dinner with the Junta's chief-of-staff Admiral
Huidobro, implying close connections with the Chilean military, and asks
Beth Horman for a list of Charles' friends which was refused.

Every element in the dramatized scene is traceable to an actual fact
about or statement by Ray Davis derived from Hauser's book. The book
establishes that Ray Davis  was in charge of the American
investigation into Charles Horman's disappearance.

##### 2. *The Hotel Meeting*

The film depicts a meeting at the Hormans' hotel at which Putnam, Clay,
and Tower are present. Clay states that a fingerprint check made at all
the morgues came up negative in the search for Horman's whereabouts and
that Captain Tower checked them himself.

The book describes the fingerprint report by governmental officials, and
this scene is a composite of those who checked on the morgue and the
fingerprints. *Execution* chronicles Ray Davis' statements that he made
inquiries with friends in the Chilean military and was checking "all
possible leads."

##### 3. *The Stadium*

In this scene the language is taken straight from *Execution;* the scene
indicates that Tower and Putnam accompany Ed and Beth Horman to the
National Stadium to search for Charles. American official presence at
the stadium, including the suggestion that Davis was involved in the
investigation into Charles' disappearance, are clearly indicated in
Hauser's account. Indeed, *Execution* portrays that Ray Davis was "in
charge of the investigation."

##### 4. *The Final Embassy Meeting*

In this scene Ed Horman tells Tower and the Embassy officials that he does not think that the military would kill Charles "unless an American official co-signed a kill order" and further indicates that he believes that American officials knew from the start that Charles was dead. These statements by Horman in the film directly reflect his beliefs as described in Hauser's book and as known to the filmmakers.

##### 5. *The Airport Scene*

In this scene Ed Horman tells Putnam, with Tower standing nearby, "I'm
gonna sue you, Phil, and Tower and the Ambassador, and everybody who let
that boy die." While the locale for this confrontation is not placed at
an airport by *Execution,* the speech accurately depicts Ed Horman's
state of mind as described in *Execution.* Horman did sue eleven
government officials.

##### 6. *The Bathroom Scene*

This scene shows Beth Horman in the bathtub at Tower's house when Tower
walks into the bathroom with a drink in his hand. Tower says, "You know,
if I were you, I'd quit living in the past. I think it's about time you
started thinking about your future." Tower exhorts Beth to "stay ahead
of the power curve" as Beth quickly exits the room.

Each of these events is taken almost directly from Hauser's book.
According to Costa-Gavras' affidavit, Joyce Horman told Costa-Gavras
that the book's description of events at Ray Davis's home was actually
understated and overly charitable to Davis, both in describing how much
he had to drink and in detailing precisely what occurred when he entered
her bathroom.

##### 7. *The Meeting with Paris*

In this scene, Paris, described as a desperate former employee of the
Junta, tells Ed Horman that a friend was present and saw Charles
detained at the Ministry of Defense in the office of Chilean General
Lutz, after he was arrested. According to the friend, an American
official was present in the office when the decision was made that the
prisoner "must 'disappear'" because "he knew too much." Paris could not
identify the American official but noted that, "The ministry is full of
them. Their Milgroup office is just down the hall from the General."

This scene is taken directly from Hauser's book, which describes in
detail the allegations of a Chilean defector and former employee of the
Chilean Intelligence Service, Rafael Gonzalez.

##### 8. *The Mafia Speech*

Tower analogizes Charles' death with the murder of someone who becomes
involved with the Mafia. In fact, plaintiff Ray Davis himself made such
a statement and this is documented in *Execution.* Interestingly, these
statements were made by Davis to Thomas Hauser while the latter was
researching his book.

##### 9. *The Telephone Repair Scene*

This scene contains the suggestion that Ed Horman's telephone at his
hotel is wiretapped. A telephone repairman leaves the hotel room and Ed
Horman tells him there was nothing wrong with the phone, and Beth is
portrayed as saying, "hello Ray Tower, how's every little thing."

*Execution* documents the incident with Ed Horman's clear impression
that either the Chilean government or American officials had bugged his
phone.


## Privacy Rights 

### Invasion of Privacy

Privacy rights come in four different flavors, best described by Justice Louis Brandeis in a famous [1890 Harvard Law Review article][brandeis_article] as "the right to be left alone." 

1. Intrusion - Unreasonable intrusion on personal solitude.
2. Publication of Private Facts - Public disclosure of true but embarrassing private facts.
3. False Light - Presentation of people in a false light in the public eye.
4. Celebrity Publicity Rights - Appropriation of one's name, image, or likeness.

* [If Only J-Law Could Retain Brandeis](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-09-05/if-only-j-law-could-retain-brandeis?alcmpid=view).

#### 1. Intrusion Upon Seclusion

> One who intentionally intrudes, 
> physically or otherwise, 
> upon the solitude or seclusion of another 
> or his private affairs or concerns, 
> is subject to liability to the other 
> for invasion of his privacy, 
> if the intrusion would be highly offensive 
> to a reasonable person.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts ยง 652B: Intrusion upon Seclusion](http://tinyurl.com/lqqgzng)

#### 2. Publication of Private Facts

###### aka Public disclosure of true but embarrassing private facts.

> One who gives publicity to a matter concerning the private life of another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the matter publicized is of a kind that:

> (a) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and
> (b) is not of legitimate concern to the public.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts ยง 652D: Publicity Given to Private Life](http://tinyurl.com/njkdaxt)

#### 3. False Light

> One who gives publicity to a matter concerning another 
> that places the other before the public in a false light 
> is subject to liability to the other 
> for invasion of his privacy, if:

> (a) the false light in which the other was placed would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and
> (b) the actor had knowledge of or acted in reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light in which the other would be placed.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts ยง 652E: Publicity Placing Person in False Light](http://tinyurl.com/lbhzrf5)

False light is a close cousin to defamation, and the two torts are often pled together. In [*Douglass v. Hustler Magazine,*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=769+F.2d+1128&appflag=67.12) (7th Cir 1985), Judge Richard Posner explained the difference this way:

> The false-light tort, to the extent distinct from the tort of defamation (but there is indeed considerable overlap), rests on an awareness that people who are made to seem pathetic or ridiculous may be shunned, and not just people who are thought to be dishonest or incompetent or
immoral. 

Defamation focuses on the damage to the plaintiffโs reputation in the community, while false light privacy concentrates on the psychological harm done to the plaintiff from objectionable misrepresentations.

### *Shulman v. Group W. Productions* (CA 1998) 

Please read this case in its entirety. It reads like a law review article on the differences between various privacy rights.

* [case at Google scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=699835474797912872)

A medical news team (with a private paramedic and a ride-along cameraman) covered a car crash in which Ruth Shulman was gravely injured. The news team filmed the scene and put a mic on a nurse, who went into the helicopter where Ruth Shulman was being treated for her injuries.

The accident turned Ruth Shulman into a paraplegic. The news team videotaped her saying things like, "I just want to die. I donโt want to go through with this." Shulman was in a state of shock at the accident scene, so she did not recall that her statements were videotaped and recorded.

Three months after the accident, Ruth Shulman watched herself on *On Scene: Emergency Response*, a reality news show. The producers did not use her last name, but Shulman was upset that her comments and images of her were enhanced, and then aired on national television โ without her permission. 

Ruth Shulman sued for invasion of privacy. Her case was dismissed when the Superior Court ruled that the media had a First Amendment right to videotape and broadcast the sights and sounds of her ordeal. 

Shulman then appealed to the California Supreme Court. In an important decision for the right of privacy, the Supreme Court found for Ruth Shulman by ruling that the reality TV show producers intruded on Ruth Shulman's right of privacy at the scene of the highway accident by filming and recording her ordeal without her permission.

## Haynes v. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.

###### US Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit (1993)

* [case on Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1592914839096728664)

POSNER, Chief Judge.

Luther Haynes and his wife, Dorothy Haynes nรฉe Johnson, appeal from the
dismissal on the defendants' motion for summary judgment of their suit
against Nicholas Lemann, the author of a highly praised, best-selling
book of social and political history called *The Promised Land: The
Great Black Migration and How It Changed America* (1991), and Alfred A.
Knopf, Inc., the book's publisher. The plaintiffs claim that the book
libels Luther Haynes and invades both plaintiffs' right of privacy.
Federal jurisdiction is based on diversity, and the common law of
Illinois is agreed to govern the substantive issues. The appeal presents
difficult issues at the intersection of tort law and freedom of the
press.

Between 1940 and 1970, five million blacks moved from impoverished rural
areas in the South to the cities of the North in search of a better
life. Some found it, and after sojourns of shorter or greater length in
the poor black districts of the cities moved to middle-class areas.
Others, despite the ballyhooed efforts of the federal government,
particularly between 1964 and 1972, to erase poverty and racial
discrimination, remained mired in what has come to be called the "urban
ghetto." *The Promised Land* is a history of the migration. It is not
history as a professional historian, a demographer, or a social
scientist would write it. Lemann is none of these. He is a journalist
and has written a journalistic history, in which the focus is on
individuals whether powerful or representative. In the former group are
the politicians who invented, executed, or exploited the "Great Society"
programs. In the latter are a handful of the actual migrants. Foremost
among these is Ruby Lee Daniels. Her story is the spine of the book. We
are introduced to her on page 7; we take leave of her on page 346,
within a few pages of the end of the text of the book.

When we meet her, it is the early 1940s and she is a young woman picking
cotton on a plantation in Clarksdale, Mississippi. "[B]lack sharecropper
society on the eve of the introduction [in the 1940s] of the mechanical
cotton picker [a major spur to the migration] was the equivalent of
big-city ghetto society today in many ways. It was the national center
of illegitimate childbearing and of the female-headed family." Ruby had
married young, but after her husband had been inducted into the army on
the eve of World War II she had fallen in love with a married man, by
whom she had had a child. The man's wife died and Ruby married him, but
they broke up after a month. Glowing reports from an aunt who had moved
to Chicago persuaded Ruby Daniels to move there in 1946. She found a job
doing janitorial work, but eventually lost the job and went on public
aid. She was unmarried, and had several children, when in 1953 she met
"the most important man in her life." Luther Haynes, born in 1924 or
1925, a sharecropper from Mississippi, had moved to Chicago in an effort
to effect a reconciliation with his wife. The effort had failed. When he
met Ruby Daniels he had a well-paying job in an awning factory. They
lived together, and had children. But then "Luther began to drink too
much. When he drank he got mean, and he and Ruby would get into
ferocious quarrels. He was still working, but he wasn't always bringing
his paycheck home." Ruby got work as a maid. They moved to a poorer part
of the city. The relationship went downhill. "It got to the point where
[Luther] would go out on Friday evenings after picking up his paycheck,
and Ruby would hope he wouldn't come home, because she knew he would be
drunk. On the Friday evenings when he did come home โ over the years
Ruby developed a devastating  imitation of Luther, and could
recreate the scene quite vividly โ he would walk into the apartment, put
on a record and turn up the volume, and saunter into their bedroom, a
bottle in one hand and a cigarette in the other, in the mood for love.
On one such night, Ruby's last child, Kevin, was conceived. Kevin always
had something wrong with him โ he was very moody, he was scrawny, and he
had a severe speech impediment. Ruby was never able to find out exactly
what the problem was, but she blamed it on Luther; all that alcohol must
have gotten into his sperm, she said."

Ruby was on public aid, but was cut off when social workers discovered
she had a man in the house. She got a night job. Luther was supposed to
stay with the children while she was at work, especially since they
lived in a dangerous neighborhood; but often when she came home, at 3:00
a.m. or so, she would "find the older children awake, and when she would
ask them if Luther had been there, the answer would be, 'No, ma'am.'"
Ruby's last aid check, arriving providentially after she had been cut
off, enabled the couple to buy a modest house on contract โ it "was, by
a wide margin, the best place she had ever lived." But "after only a few
months, Luther ruined everything by going out and buying a brand-new
1961 Pontiac. It meant more to him than the house did, and when they
couldn't make the house payment, he insisted on keeping the car" even
though she hadn't enough money to buy shoes for the children. The family
was kicked out of the house. They now moved frequently. They were
reaching rock bottom. At this nadir, hope appeared in the ironic form of
the Robert Taylor Homes, then a brand-new public housing project, now a
notorious focus of drug addiction and gang violence. Ruby had had an
application for public housing on file for many years, but the housing
authority screened out unwed mothers. Told by a social worker that she
could have an apartment in the Taylor Homes if she produced a marriage
license, she and Luther (who was now divorced from his first wife) were
married forthwith and promptly accepted as tenants. "The Haynes family
chose to rejoice in their good fortune in becoming residents of the
Robert Taylor Homes. As Ruby's son Larry, who was twelve years old at
the time, says, 'I thought that was the beautifullest place in the
world.'"

Even in the halcyon days of 1962, the Robert Taylor Homes were no
paradise. There was considerable crime, and there were gangs, and Ruby's
son Kermit joined one. Kermit was not Luther's son and did not recognize
his authority. The two quarreled a lot. Meanwhile Luther had lost his
job in the awning factory "that he had had for a decade, and then
bounced around a little. He lost jobs because of transportation
problems, because of layoffs, because of a bout of serious illness,
because of his drinking, because he had a minor criminal record (having
been in jail for disorderly conduct following a fight with Ruby), and
because creditors were after him." He resumed "his old habit of not
returning from work on Fridays after he got his paycheck." One weekend
he didn't come home at all. In a search of his things Ruby discovered
evidence that Luther was having an affair with Dorothy Johnson, a former
neighbor. "Luther was not being particularly careful; he saw in Dorothy,
who was younger than Ruby, who had three children compared to Ruby's
eight, who had a job while Ruby was on public aid, the promise of an
escape from the ghetto, and he was entranced." The children discovered
the affair. Kermit tried to strangle Luther. In 1965 Luther moved out
permanently, and eventually he and Ruby divorced.

Ruby remained in the Robert Taylor Homes until 1979, when she moved back
to Clarksdale. She had become eligible for social security in 1978; and
with her surviving children (one of her sons had died, either a suicide
or murdered) now adults, though most of them deeply troubled adults and
Kevin, whom Ruby in a custody proceeding described as retarded, still
living at home, Ruby "is settling into old age with a sense of
contentment about the circumstances she has found." But "there has
always been that nagging sensation of incompleteness, which made itself
felt most directly in her relationships with men."

After divorcing Ruby, Luther Haynes married Dorothy Johnson.
He is still married to her, "owns a home on the far South Side of
Chicago, and has worked for years as a parking-lot attendant; only
recently have he and Ruby found that they can speak civilly to each
other on the phone."

There is much more to the book than our paraphrase and excerptsโmuch
about other migrants, about the travails of Ruby's children, about
discrimination against blacks in both the North and the South, and about
the politics of poverty programs in Washington and Chicago. But the
excerpts we have quoted contain all the passages upon which the
Hayneses' lawsuit is founded.

### Defamation

The charge of libel is confined to three statements in the book: that Haynes left his children alone at night when he was supposed to be watching them; that he lost a job or jobs because of drinking; and that he spent money on a car that he should have used to buy shoes for his children.&hellip; 

[The court said that the district court properly dismissed these claims because they were substantial true, and (as we know) truth is a defense to a claim of defamation.]

### Invasion of Privacy

The major claim in the complaint, and the focus of the appeal, is not
defamation, however; it is invasion of the right of privacy. In tort law
the term "right of privacy" covers several distinct wrongs. Using a
celebrity's (or other person's) name or picture in advertising without
his consent. [*Carson v. Here's Johnny Portable Toilets, Inc.,* (6th
Cir. 1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18021528625868373370);
[*Martin Luther King, Jr., Center for Social Change, Inc. v. American
Heritage Products, Inc.,* (GA 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1102676940012657150);
[*Douglass v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.* (7th Cir. 1985)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17887957795289404111).
Tapping someone's phone, or otherwise invading a person's private space.
Harassing a celebrity by following her too closely, albeit on a public street. Cf. [*Galella v. Onassis* (2d Cir. 1973)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1876391558280554729). Casting a person in a false light by publicizing details of the person's life that while true are so selected or highlighted as to convey a misleading impression of the person's character. [*Time, Inc. v. Hill* (S.Ct. 1967)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13178370409068522665).  Publicizing personal facts that while true and not misleading are so intimate that their disclosure to the public is deeply embarrassing to the person thus exposed and is perceived as gratuitous by the community (many citations omitted).

The last, the publicizing of personal facts, 
is the aspect of invasion of privacy charged by the Hayneses.

Even people who have nothing rationally to be ashamed of can be
mortified by the publication of intimate details of their life. Most
people in no wise deformed or disfigured would nevertheless be deeply
upset if nude photographs of themselves were published in a newspaper or
a book. They feel the same way about photographs of their sexual
activities, however "normal," or about a narrative of those activities,
or about having their medical records publicized. Although it is well 
known that every human being defecates, no adult human being in our
society wants a newspaper to show a picture of him defecating. The
desire for privacy illustrated by these examples is a mysterious but
deep fact about human personality. It deserves and in our society
receives legal protection. The nature of the injury shows, by the way,
that the defendants are wrong to argue that this branch of the right of
privacy requires proof of special damages. 

But this is not the character of the depictions of the Hayneses in *The
Promised Land.* Although the plaintiff's claim that the book depicts
their "sex life" and "ridicules" Luther Haynes's lovemaking (the
reference is to the passage we quoted in which the author refers to
Ruby's "devastating imitation" of Luther's manner when he would come
home Friday nights in an amorous mood), these characterizations are
misleading. No sexual act is described in the book. No intimate details
are revealed. Entering one's bedroom with a bottle in one hand and a
cigarette in the other is not foreplay. Ruby's speculation that Kevin's
problems may have been due to Luther's having been a heavy drinker is
not the narration of a sexual act.&hellip; 

Haynes denies that his drinking had anything to do with his son Kevin's
defects or that he was actuated by mercenary considerations in leaving
Ruby for Dorothy. These denials, we have seen, could not be made the
basis of a libel case &hellip; 
No more, we think, can they be used to enhance a privacy case.&hellip; 

Indeed, that type of case presupposes the truth of the facts disclosed. 
If they are false, the interest invaded is that protected by the
defamation and false-light torts: the interest in being represented
truthfully to the world.&hellip; 

This is an aside. The branch of privacy law that the Hayneses invoke in
their appeal is not concerned with, and is not a proper surrogate for
legal doctrines that are concerned with, the accuracy of the private
facts revealed. It is concerned with the propriety of stripping away the
veil of privacy with which we cover the embarrassing, the shameful, the
tabooed, truths about us. &hellip; 

The revelations in the book are not about the intimate details of the
Hayneses' life. They are about misconduct, in particular Luther's.
(There is very little about Dorothy in the book, apart from the fact
that she had had an affair with Luther while he was still married to
Ruby and that they eventually became and have remained lawfully
married.) The revelations are about his heavy drinking, his unstable
employment, his adultery, his irresponsible and neglectful behavior
toward his wife and children. So we must consider cases in which the
right of privacy has been invoked as a shield against the revelation of
previous misconduct.&hellip; 

The Court must
believe that the First Amendment greatly circumscribes the right even of
a private figure to obtain damages for the publication of newsworthy
facts about him, even when they are facts of a kind that people want
very much to conceal. &hellip; 

Luther Haynes did not aspire to be a
representative figure in the great black migration from the South to the
North. People who do not desire the limelight and do not deliberately
choose a way of life or course of conduct calculated to thrust them into
it nevertheless have no legal right to extinguish it if the experiences
that have befallen them are newsworthy, even if they would prefer that
those experiences be kept private. The possibility of an involuntary
loss of privacy is recognized in the modern formulations of this branch
of the privacy tort, which require not only that the private facts
publicized be such as would make a reasonable person deeply offended by
such publicity but also that they be facts in which the public has no
legitimate interest. 

The two criteria, offensiveness and newsworthiness, are related. An
individual, and more pertinently perhaps the community, is most offended
by the publication of intimate personal facts when the community has no
interest in them beyond the voyeuristic thrill of penetrating the wall
of privacy that surrounds a stranger. The reader of a book about the
black migration to the North would have no legitimate interest in the
details of Luther Haynes's sex life; but no such details are disclosed.
Such a reader does have a legitimate interest in the aspects of Luther's
conduct that the book reveals. For one of Lemann's major themes is the
transposition virtually intact of a sharecropper morality characterized
by a family structure "matriarchal and elastic" and by an "extremely
unstable" marriage bond to the slums of the northern cities, and the
interaction, largely random and sometimes perverse, of that morality
with governmental programs to alleviate poverty. Public aid policies
discouraged Ruby and Luther from living together; public housing
policies precipitated a marriage  doomed to fail. No detail in
the book claimed to invade the Hayneses' privacy is not germane to the
story that the author wanted to tell, a story not only of legitimate but
of transcendent public interest.

The Hayneses question whether the linkage between the author's theme and
their private life really is organic. They point out that many social
histories do not mention individuals at all, let alone by name. That is
true. Much of social science, including social history, proceeds by
abstraction, aggregation, and quantification rather than by case
studies; the economist Robert Fogel has won a Nobel prize for his
statistical studies of economic history, including, not wholly unrelated
to the subject of Lemann's book, the history of Negro slavery in the
United States. But it would be absurd to suggest that cliometric or
other aggregative, impersonal methods of doing social history are the
only proper way to go about it and presumptuous to claim even that they
are the best way. Lemann's book has been praised to the skies by
distinguished scholars, among them black scholars covering a large
portion of the ideological spectrum โ Henry Louis Gates Jr., William
Julius Wilson, and Patricia Williams. Lemann's methodology places the
individual case history at center stage. If he cannot tell the story of
Ruby Daniels without waivers from every person who she thinks did her
wrong, he cannot write this book.

Well, argue the Hayneses, at least Lemann could have changed their
names. But the use of pseudonyms would not have gotten Lemann and Knopf
off the legal hook. The details of the Hayneses' lives recounted in the
book would identify them unmistakably to anyone who has known the
Hayneses well for a long time (members of their families, for example),
or who knew them before they got married; and no more is required for
liability either in defamation law (citations omitted).

Lemann would have had to change some, perhaps many, of the details. But
then he would no longer have been writing history. He would have been
writing fiction. The nonquantitative study of living persons would be
abolished as a category of scholarship, to be replaced by the
sociological novel. That is a genre with a distinguished history
punctuated by famous names, such as Dickens, Zola, Stowe, Dreiser,
Sinclair, Steinbeck, and Wolfe, but we do not think that the law of
privacy makes it (or that the First Amendment would permit the law of
privacy to make it) the exclusive format for a social history of living
persons that tells their story rather than treating them as data points
in a statistical study. Reporting the true facts about real people is
necessary to "obviate any impression that the problems raised in the
[book] are remote or hypothetical." &hellip; 
And surely a composite portrait of ghetto residents would be attacked as
racial stereotyping.

*The Promised Land* does not afford the reader a titillating glimpse of
tabooed activities. The tone is decorous and restrained. Painful though
it is for the Hayneses to see a past they would rather forget brought
into the public view, the public needs the information conveyed by the
book, including the information about Luther and Dorothy Haynes, in
order to evaluate the profound social and political questions that the
book raises. Given the *Cox* decision, moreover, all the discreditable
facts about the Hayneses that are contained in judicial records are
beyond the power of tort law to conceal; and the disclosure of those
facts alone would strip away the Hayneses' privacy as effectively as
*The Promised Land* has done. (This *case,* it could be argued, has
stripped them of their privacy, since their story is now part of a
judicial record โ the record of this case.) We do not think it is an
answer that Lemann got his facts from Ruby Daniels rather than from
judicial records. The courts got the facts from Ruby. We cannot see what
difference it makes that Lemann went to the source.&hellip; 

To any suggestion that the outer bounds of liability should be left to a
jury to decide we reply that in cases involving the rights protected by
the speech and press clauses of the First Amendment the courts insist on
firm judicial control of the jury. For the general principle, see [*New
York Times Co. v. Sullivan* (S.Ct. 1964)][sullivan].

The publication of books is not at the sufferance of juries.

Does it follow, as the Hayneses' lawyer asked us rhetorically at oral
argument, that a journalist who wanted to write a book about
contemporary sexual practices could include the intimate details of
named living persons' sexual acts without the persons' consent? Not
necessarily, although the revelation of such details in the memoirs of
former spouses and lovers is common enough and rarely provokes a lawsuit
even when the former spouse or lover is still alive. The core of the
branch of privacy law with which we have been dealing in this case is
the protection of those intimate physical details the publicizing of
which would be not merely embarrassing  and painful but deeply
shocking to the average person subjected to such exposure. The public
has a legitimate interest in sexuality, but that interest may be
outweighed in such a case by the injury to the sensibilities of the
persons made use of by the author in such a way. *Restatement (Second)
of Torts, supra,* ยง 652D, comment h. At least the balance would be
sufficiently close to preclude summary judgment for the author and
publisher (citations omitted). 

The judgment for the defendants is

AFFIRMED.

### Public Figures <a name="public_figures"></a>

Most defamation and privacy cases deal early on with the issue of whether plaintiff is a public or a private figure. In struggling with these question, courts have discussed at least three varieties of public figures.

1. General-purpose public figures;
2. Limited-purpose public figures;
3. Involuntary public figures.

#### General Purpose Public Figures.

These are easy to spot, as the D.C. Circuit put it in 
[*Waldbaum v. Fairchild Publications*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=90016016899445152060):

> A general public figure is a well-known "celebrity," 
> his name a "household word." 
> The public recognizes him and follows his words and deeds, 
> either because it regards his ideas, conduct, or judgment 
> as worthy of the attention 
> or because he actively pursues that consideration.

#### Limited-Purpose Public Figure

In its leading opinion on public *figures*, [*Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.* (S.Ct. 1974)][gertz], as opposed to public *officials*, [*New York Times v. Sullivan* (S.Ct. 1968)][sullivan], the United States Supreme Court identified at least two kinds of public figures:

> In some instances 
> an individual may achieve such pervasive fame or notoriety 
> that he becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all contexts. 
> More commonly, an *individual voluntarily injects himself 
> or is drawn into a particular public controversy 
> and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues*. 
> In either case 
> such persons assume special prominence in the resolution of public questions.

> Absent clear evidence of general fame or notoriety in the community, and pervasive involvement in the affairs of society, an individual should not be deemed a public personality for all aspects of his life. It is preferable to reduce the public-figure question to a more meaningful context by looking to the nature and extent of an individual's participation in the particular controversy giving rise to the defamation.

The states and federal circuits have developed different tests for deciding whether and when a person is a limited-purpose public figure. The Fifth Circuit uses a three-part test:

1. The controversy at issue must be public both in the sense that people are discussing it and people other than the immediate participants in the controversy are likely to feel the impact of its resolution;
2. The plaintiff must have more than a trivial or tangential role in the controversy; and,
3. The alleged defamation must be germane to the plaintiff's participation in the controversy.

The Second Circuit uses a four-factor inquiry, which focuses on plaintiff's participation in the public controversy. This test requires the defendant to prove that plaintiff:

1. Successfully invited public attention to his views in an effort to influence others prior to the incident that is the subject of litigation;
2. Voluntarily injected himself into a public controversy related to the subject of the litigation; 
3. Assumed a position of prominence in the public controversy; and
4. Maintained regular and continuing access to the media.

The plaintiff in *Street v. NBC* (below) is a textbook example of a public figure for a limited purpose. 

#### Involuntary Public Figures

Some read [*Gertz*][gertz] as identifying yet a third variety of public figure, the involuntary public figure, based upon the Court's observation that:

> Hypothetically, it may be possible for someone to become a public figure through no purposeful action of his own, *but the instances of truly involuntary public figures must be exceedingly rare.* For the most part those who attain this status have assumed roles of especial prominence in the affairs of society. Some occupy positions of such persuasive power and influence that they are deemed public figures for all purposes. More commonly, those classed as public figures have thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved. In either event, they invite attention and comment.

These distinction in the small number of cases discussing involuntary public figures seems to turn on whether the plaintiff voluntary sought to play a public role in the controversy that gave rise to her notoriety. Modern commentators suggest that even vigorous use of social media (Twitter, Facebook, and the like) could be used as evidence of one's public figure status.

## What About Other Torts?

What if instead of suing for defamation, the unhappy public figure sues for intentional infliction of emotional distress?

## *Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell,*

###### United States Supreme Court (1988)

* [*Hustler v. Falwell* at Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5069891851949874011).
* [*Hustler v. Falwell* at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustler_Magazine_v._Falwell). 
* [Image of the Campari ad](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/falwell/campariL.jpg).

The inside front cover of the November 1983 issue of Hustler Magazine
featured a "parody" of an advertisement for Campari Liqueur that
contained the name and picture of preacher Jerry Falwell and was entitled "Jerry
Falwell talks about his first time." This parody was modeled after
actual Campari ads that included interviews with various celebrities
about their "first times." Although it was apparent by the end of each
interview that this meant the first time they sampled Campari, the ads
clearly played on the sexual double entendre of the general subject of
"first times." Copying the form and layout of these Campari ads,
Hustler's editors chose Falwell as the featured celebrity and drafted
an alleged "interview" with him in which he states that his "first time"
was during a drunken incestuous rendezvous with his mother in an
outhouse. The Hustler parody portrays Falwell and his mother as drunk
and immoral, and suggests that Falwell is a hypocrite who preaches
only when he is drunk. In small print at the bottom of the page, the ad
contains the disclaimer, "ad parody โ not to be taken seriously." The
magazine's table of contents also lists the ad as "Fiction; Ad and
Personality Parody."

Soon after the November issue of Hustler became available to the public, Falwell sued Hustler Magazine and Larry Flynt to recover damages for libel, invasion of privacy, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. The case proceeded to
trial. At the close of the evidence, the District Court
granted a directed verdict for Flynt and Hustler on the invasion of privacy
claim. The jury then found against Falwell on the libel claim,
specifically finding that the ad parody could not "reasonably be
understood as describing actual facts about Falwell or actual
events in which [he] participated." The jury found for Falwell on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, however, and stated that he should be awarded $100,000 in

On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
affirmed &hellip; rejecting Flynt and Hustler's argument that the "actual malice"
standard of [*New York Times Co.* v. *Sullivan* (S.Ct. 1964)][sullivan] 
must be met before Falwell (concededly a public figure) could recover for emotional distress.

In the Fourth Circuit's view, the *New York Times* decision emphasized the
constitutional importance not of the falsity of the statement or the
defendant's disregard for the truth, but of the heightened level of
culpability embodied in the requirement of "knowing . . . or reckless"
conduct. Here, the *New York*  *Times* standard is satisfied by
the state-law requirement, and the jury's finding, that the defendants
have acted intentionally or recklessly, and that the sole issue before the court was "whether [the ad's] publication was sufficiently outrageous to constitute intentional
infliction of emotional distress." 

This case presents us with a novel question involving First Amendment
limitations upon a State's authority to protect its citizens from the
intentional infliction of emotional distress. We must decide whether a
public figure may recover damages for emotional harm caused by the
publication of an ad parody offensive to him, and doubtless gross and
repugnant in the eyes of most. Falwell would have us find that a
State's interest in protecting public figures from emotional distress is
sufficient to deny First Amendment protection to speech that is patently
offensive and is intended to inflict emotional injury, even when that
speech could not reasonably have been interpreted as stating actual
facts about the public figure involved. This we decline to do.&hellip;

Of course, this does not mean that *any* speech about a public figure is
immune from sanction in the form of damages. Since [*New York Times Co.*
v. *Sullivan* (S.Ct. 1964),][sullivan] we have consistently ruled that a public figure may hold a speaker liable for the damage to reputation caused by publication of a
defamatory falsehood, but only if the statement was made "with knowledge
that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or
not." &hellip; False statements of fact are particularly
valueless; they interfere with the truth-seeking function of the
marketplace of ideas, and they cause damage to an individual's
reputation that cannot easily be repaired by counterspeech, however
persuasive or effective.&hellip; 

But even though falsehoods have little value in and of themselves, they
are "nevertheless inevitable in free debate," and a rule
that would impose strict liability on a publisher for false factual
assertions would have an undoubted "chilling" effect on speech relating
to public figures that does have constitutional value. "Freedoms of
expression require " 'breathing space.'" &hellip; This breathing space is provided by a constitutional rule that allows
public figures to recover for libel or defamation only when they can
prove *both* that the statement was false and that the statement was
made with the requisite level of culpability.

Falwell argues, however, that a different standard should apply in
this case because here the State seeks to prevent not reputational
damage, but the severe emotional distress suffered by the person who is
the subject of an offensive publication.

In Falwell's view, and in the
view of the  Court of Appeals, so long as the utterance was
intended to inflict emotional distress, was outrageous, and did in fact
inflict serious emotional distress, it is of no constitutional import
whether the statement was a fact or an opinion, or whether it was true
or false. It is the intent to cause injury that is the gravamen of the
tort, and the State's interest in preventing emotional harm simply
outweighs whatever interest a speaker may have in speech of this type.

Generally speaking the law does not regard the intent to inflict
emotional distress as one which should receive much solicitude, and it
is quite understandable that most if not all jurisdictions have chosen
to make it civilly culpable where the conduct in question is
sufficiently "outrageous." But in the world of debate about public
affairs, many things done with motives that are less than admirable are
protected by the First Amendment. &hellip; Even when a speaker or writer is motivated by hatred or ill
will his expression was protected by the First Amendment:

> "Debate on public issues will not be uninhibited if the speaker must
> run the risk that it will be proved in court that he spoke out of
> hatred; even if he did speak out of hatred, utterances honestly
> believed contribute to the free interchange of ideas and the
> ascertainment of truth." 

Thus while such a bad motive may be deemed controlling for purposes of
tort liability in other areas of the law, we think the First Amendment
prohibits such a result in the area of public debate about public
figures.

Were we to hold otherwise, there can be little doubt that political
cartoonists and satirists would be subjected to damages awards without
any showing that their work falsely defamed its subject. Webster's
defines a caricature as "the deliberately distorted picturing or
imitating of a person, literary style, etc. by exaggerating features or
mannerisms for satirical effect." The appeal of the political cartoon or caricature is often based on exploitation of unfortunate physical traits or politically embarrassing events โ an exploitation often calculated to injure the feelings of the subject of the portrayal. The art of the cartoonist is often not reasoned or evenhanded, but slashing and one-sided. One cartoonist
expressed the nature of the art in these words:

> "The political cartoon is a weapon of attack, of scorn and ridicule
> and satire; it is least effective when it tries to pat some politician
> on the back. It is usually as welcome as a bee sting and is always
> controversial in some quarters."

Several famous examples of this type of intentionally injurious speech
were drawn by Thomas Nast, probably the greatest American cartoonist to
date, who was associated for many years during the post-Civil War era
with Harper's Weekly. In the pages of that publication Nast conducted a
graphic vendetta against William M. "Boss" Tweed and his corrupt
associates in New York City's "Tweed Ring." It has been described by one
historian of the subject as "a sustained attack which in its passion and
effectiveness stands alone in the history of American graphic art." &hellip;
Another writer
explains that the success of the Nast cartoon was achieved "because of
the emotional impact of its presentation. It continuously goes beyond
the bounds of good taste and conventional manners."

Despite their sometimes caustic nature, from the early cartoon
portraying George Washington as an ass down to the present day, graphic
depictions and satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in public
and political debate. Nast's castigation of the Tweed Ring, Walt
McDougall's characterization of Presidential candidate James G. Blaine's
banquet with the millionaires at Delmonico's as "The Royal  Feast
of Belshazzar," and numerous other efforts have undoubtedly had an
effect on the course and outcome of contemporaneous debate. Lincoln's
tall, gangling posture, Teddy Roosevelt's glasses and teeth, and
Franklin D. Roosevelt's jutting jaw and cigarette holder have been
memorialized by political cartoons with an effect that could not have
been obtained by the photographer or the portrait artist. From the
viewpoint of history it is clear that our political discourse would have
been considerably poorer without them.

Falwell contends, however, that the caricature in question here was
so "outrageous" as to distinguish it from more traditional political
cartoons. There is no doubt that the caricature of Falwell and his
mother published in Hustler is at best a distant cousin of the political
cartoons described above, and a rather poor relation at that. If it were
possible by laying down a principled standard to separate the one from
the other, public discourse would probably suffer little or no harm. But
we doubt that there is any such standard, and we are quite sure that the
pejorative description "outrageous" does not supply one.
"Outrageousness" in the area of political and social discourse has an
inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to impose
liability on the basis of the jurors' tastes or views, or perhaps on the
basis of their dislike of a particular expression. An "outrageousness"
standard thus runs afoul of our longstanding refusal to allow damages to
be awarded because the speech in question may have an adverse emotional
impact on the audience.&hellip; 

> We conclude that public figures and public officials may not recover for
the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress by reason of
publications such as the one here at issue without showing in addition
that the publication *contains a false statement of fact* which was made
with "actual malice," *i.e.,* with knowledge that the statement was
false or with reckless disregard as to whether or not it was true. 

For reasons heretofore stated this claim cannot, consistently with
the First Amendment, form a basis for the award of damages when the
conduct in question is the publication of a caricature such as the ad
parody involved here. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
accordingly

*Reversed.*

<!-- BEGIN COMMENT -->

<!--

Actual malice is different from common law malice which indicates spite or ill-will. It may also differ from "actual malice" as defined in state libel law, as was confirmed in the case of Carol Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc. (1983). Also see HERBERT v. LANDO, (1979) 441 U.S. 153 (1979)441 U.S. 153 fn 12; "The existence of actual malice may be shown in many ways. As a general rule, any competent evidence, either direct or circumstantial, can be resorted to, and all the relevant circumstances surrounding the transaction may be shown, provided they are not too remote, including threats, prior or subsequent defamations, subsequent statements of the defendant, circumstances indicating the existence of rivalry, ill will, or hostility between the parties, facts tending to show a reckless disregard of the plaintiff's rights..."


To ensure that true speech on matters of public concern is not deterred, we hold that the common-law presumption that defamatory speech is false cannot stand when a plaintiff seeks damages against a media defendant.
